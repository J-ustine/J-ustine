### Welcome!

:bulb: What started out as curiosity for the tech industry, turned off into a passion for software development!

:sparkles: As a developer, I love building full-stack apps from scratch, from idea to deployment using the GitHub control version. I enjoy solving logical problems and creating aesthetic products.

ðŸŒ± My aspiration is to find a team where I can grow as a professional and bring my value and fresh ideas. I am eager to learn new technologies as well as improve the current ones and I am willing to work both Frontend and Backend.
